### Display Cover Plates

A simple plate cover for a handful of displays on campus. Goes into a USB-A port and hides everything to the left and right of it. Embezzeled with an altered steamboat horse for some addded flair. Intended Promethean and NewLine Displays (bottom left of the display).
There are two sizes and two versions of both included here. There is a model for two colors and single colored plates. The accented frame color comes from the brim during a print.

### Display/Q-SYS Touch Panel Mount
A mount for the Q-SYS touch panel that snaps on to the back of one of the displays we have (NEC E988). It is recommended that this model is printed with an increased infil, 40% seems to be a good place to make sure the feet for the Q-SYS mount are sturdy enough although switching from PLA to PETG in this case may be wise in this case.

#### Printing Notes
At C.T.S. we use the makerspace in the I.T. building at the University of Wyoming. Which has PRUSA printers with .4mm nozzles.
